Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

You may **not** modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes itself may be changed.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
