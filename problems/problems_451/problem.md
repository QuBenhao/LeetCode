# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency

Given a string `s`, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters, and return *the sorted string*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "tree"
Output: "eert"
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "cccaaa"
Output: "aaaccc"
Explanation: Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "Aabb"
Output: "bbAa"
Explanation: "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10<sup>5</sup>
- `s` consists of English letters and digits.
