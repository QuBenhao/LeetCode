# 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

There is an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with **distinct** values).

Before being passed to your function, `nums` is **rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`0 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `5` and become `[4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the rotation and an integer `target`, return `true` *if* `target` *is in* `nums`*, or* `false` *if it is not in* `nums`*.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- `nums` is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= target <= 10<sup>4</sup>

 

**Follow up:** This problem is the same as [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/), where `nums` may contain **duplicates**. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?
