# How to start

After clone this repo, add a .env file to tell where to locate your problems and solutions (locally).
For remote GitHub Action, add `COOKIE` (LeetCode cookie), `PUSH_KEY` (PushDeer notification), `PROBLEM_FOLDER` (where to
add problems), `USER` (LeetCode personal page uri), `LOG_LEVEL` (Log print).

**Notice:** If you want more than just python3, add `LANGUAGES="python3,golang"` (and so on in .env)

Example .env file:

```text
PROBLEM_FOLDER="problems"
PUSH_KEY="***[key from PushDeer]"
COOKIE="***[cookie from LeetCode graphql]"
LANGUAGES="python3,golang,java,cpp,typescript,rust"
USER="himymben"
LOG_LEVEL="info"
PYTHONPATH=.
```

install python3.12 or higher requirements:

```shell
pip install -r python/requirements.txt
```

LeetCode tools all in one
```shell
python python/scripts/leetcode.py

***DeprecationWarning: The tools below is deprecated, please use the new tools in python/scripts/leetcode.py***

To directly submit Solution to LeetCode, try any language below:

```shell
python python/scripts/submit.py -h
# usage: submit.py [-h] [-id ID] {go,py,ts,js,c++,java,golang,python3,typescript,javascript,cpp,rt,rust}
python python/scripts/submit.py python3 -id=1
python python/scripts/submit.py -id=2 py
python python/scripts/submit.py py
python python/scripts/submit.py golang -id=2
python python/scripts/submit.py cpp -id=1
python python/scripts/submit.py java -id=2
python python/scripts/submit.py typescript -id=1
python python/scripts/submit.py rust -id=1
```

To get any problem you want, try:

```shell
python python/scripts/get_problem.py -h
# usage: get_problem.py [-h] [-id PROBLEM_ID] [-slug PROBLEM_SLUG] [-cate PROBLEM_CATEGORY] [-f] [-all] [-pm] [-debug DEBUG_FILE] [-change] [-sl]
python python/scripts/get_problem.py -id=1
```

To generate daily problems, try:

```shell
python python/scripts/daily_auto.py
```

To fetch daily submits from LeetCode (requires `.env` COOKIE or USER to be ready), try:

```shell
python python/scripts/daily_submission.py
```

Some extra tools:

1. To backfield existing problems rating, try:

```shell
python python/scripts/tools.py rating
```

2. To get the lucky problem of the day, try:

```shell
python python/scripts/tools.py lucky 
```

**If you think there are too many logs for those scripts in the console, you can set the `LOG_LEVEL` in the `.env` file
to `ERROR`.**

# Supported Languages

## Python3

Check [Python3 README](python/README.md)

## Golang

Check [Golang README](golang/README.md)

## Java

Check [Java README](qubhjava/README.md)

## Cpp

Check [Cpp README](cpp/README.md)

## Typescript

Check [TypeScript README](typescript/README.md)

## Rust

Check [Rust README](rust/README.md)

# Demo

Fork the repo of your own
![fork.png](docs/fork.png)

Clone your own forked repo

**Notice: create your own branch and set it as repo default, and keep master!**

## Local

Open the code project and installed languages environments as needed.

Test your environment by running languages test, for instance:
![mvn_test.png](docs/mvn_test.png)
if you are facing errors here, contact the author.

Find a cookie from LeetCode (monthly update)
![cookie.png](docs/cookie.png)

Create your own .env file (Notice: better to use a problem folder other than exists as the author is using them, there
will be a lot of conflicts):

```
PROBLEM_FOLDER=demo
COOKIE="***[cookie from LeetCode graphql]"
LANGUAGES="golang,java"
```

Create the folder 'demo' based on your own .env

Run scripts to fetch problems, run tests and submit your solution.

If you get problem like this,
![get_problem.png](docs/get_problem.png)
it will add the problem and change the tests of your languages as below:
![new_problem.png](docs/new_problem.png)
![changed_golang.png](docs/changed_golang.png)
